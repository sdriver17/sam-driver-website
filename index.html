    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p id="bio-text"> I am a second-year college student at Wesleyan University, planning a double major in computer science and theatre. During my high school career, I began my study of computer science my freshman year, taking Intro to Java. I grew upon this foundation, completing AP Computer Science, while building a program to run a Finch Robot as a final. These classes left me with a base foundation of Object Oriented Programming, as well as strong fundamentals in Java. I have furthered this experience while at college, gaining experience in algorithm design, programming language design, and functional programming as a whole. Languages I excel in are Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C, C++, and SML.
    In addition to my educational pursuits, I am a member of the Briarcliff Manor Volunteer Fire Department. My work for the BMFD has provided me with a keen eye for details and extensive collabarative work experience.
