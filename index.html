In the theater I have extensive experience as an actor, including training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, as well as in all facets of technical theater, though I specialize in lighting design. </p>
    <p id="bio-text"> As a computer scientist I have extensive experience coding in many prominent languages including Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C, C++, and SML.
