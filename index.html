    <p id="bio-text"> Sam (He/Him/His) is a working artist and developer who is passionate about harnessing his creativity in all aspects of his work. </p>
    <p id="bio-text"> As an artist, Sam is interested in finding the intersection between theater and technology, as well as exploring the classical through the lens of modernity. 
                      He received a braod artistic education during his time at Wesleyan University, during which he honed his craft as an actor, director, and designer.
                      This training was supplemented by an intensive course of classical acting training from some of the most respected teachers in England at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.
                      As an Actor/Designer he has performed and worked on a wide variety of productions both in educational and professional settings and looks forward to seeing what comes his way next.

    <p id="bio-text"> As a developer, Sam is an endlessly curious student of the subject. 
                      Through his time at Wesleyan University, he was able to learn a variety of different languages and styles, some of which include: SML, Java/JavaScript, and C.
                      Sam was also able to foster his interest in cyber security, leading to a research project on the topic of Two-Factor Authentication and Phishing Attacks, focused on a college campus.
                      This research can be viewed <a href="https://2fa.matthewquerdasi.com/">here.</a>
                      In the professional world, Sam has worked for several companies, primarily on the backend, with occasional forays into UI/UX design and frontend implementation.
                      Sam loves to be a part of a team, and has always enjopyed working together towards a common goal with his coworkers.
