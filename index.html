    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p id="bio-text"> I am a second-year college student at Wesleyan University, planning a double major in computer science and theatre. During the course of my academic career, both in High School and College, I have accrued nearly five years of experience in technical theater. In High School, I had the privilege of working as an auditorium coordinator, and member of the school tech crew, where I learned valuable professional skills such as light board operation, hang and focus skills, carpentry, rigging, and lighting design basics. While attending the NYSTEA conference I took a course on the basics of Vectorworks, and have continued training with it in my free time. In my first year of college I was hired to work in the Wesleyan Center for the Arts theater, both setting up for, and helping to run, a variety of different performances, gaining experience in a more professional environment, and working alongside experienced professionals.
    In addition to my educational pursuits, I am a member of the Briarcliff Manor Volunteer Fire Department. My work for the BMFD has provided me with a keen eye for details and extensive collabarative work experience.
